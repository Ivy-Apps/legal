# PocketVibe Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** April 14, 2025  
**Last Updated:** April 14, 2025

Welcome to PocketVibe, an Android app developed and distributed by **Ivy Apps Ltd** ("we", "us", or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

---

## 1. Data We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide  
PocketVibe does **not** require account registration or personal information to use the app.

However, to enhance your experience, the App may store the following **locally on your device**:
- Your API key for connecting with third-party LLM services.
- Prompts you manually enter, including saved prompts and prompt history.
- Contextual information you input or generate to support future interactions with the AI.

This information is used **only within the app** and is **not transmitted to Ivy Apps Ltd servers**.

You are solely responsible for the content you input into the App, including any personal, sensitive, or confidential information. Ivy Apps Ltd does **not monitor, collect, or store** this information.

**Important Security Note Regarding API Keys:** You are solely responsible for the security of your API key. We strongly recommend that you generate a separate, limited-access API key specifically for use with PocketVibe. Do not use your primary API key.

### 1.2 Automatically Collected Information  
We use Google Firebase services to collect limited and anonymized technical data:
- **Firebase Analytics**: gathers app usage patterns and basic device data (e.g., device type, session duration).
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: collects crash logs and technical diagnostics to improve app stability.

This data is anonymized and **does not include personally identifiable information**.

**Anonymized Data and Re-identification Risk:** While we use state-of-the-art anonymization techniques, the possibility of re-identification of anonymized data cannot be completely eliminated. We are committed to regularly reviewing and updating our anonymization methods to mitigate this risk.

---

## 2. How We Use Data

We use collected data for the following purposes:
- To support app features like saving prompts and maintaining context.
- To diagnose technical issues and improve app performance.
- To analyze anonymized usage data for product development.

We **do not**:
- Sell or share your data for advertising purposes.
- Access or store your API key, prompts, or context on our servers.
- Access any AI-generated content or personal information shared with third-party services.

---

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing

We process your data under the following legal bases:
- **Legitimate Interests** (e.g., app functionality and improvement).
- **Consent**, where required (e.g., optional analytics in certain jurisdictions).
- **Compliance with Legal Obligations**.

---

## 4. Your Rights Under GDPR

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the following rights:
- **Right of Access** – Request copies of your personal data.
- **Right to Rectification** – Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Right to Erasure** – Request deletion of your data in certain circumstances.
- **Right to Restrict Processing** – Limit how we process your data.
- **Right to Object** – Object to data processing under certain conditions.
- **Right to Data Portability** – Request that we transfer data to another organization.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at iliyan.germanov971@gmail.com. We will respond within 30 days.

**Verification of GDPR Requests:** To protect your privacy, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before fulfilling any GDPR requests. This may include requesting additional information to confirm your identity.

---

## 5. Your Rights Under CCPA (California)

If you are a California resident, you may:
- Request disclosure of what personal data we collect.
- Request deletion of your data.
- Opt out of the sale of personal data (note: we do **not** sell data).

To make a CCPA request, email us at iliyan.germanov971@gmail.com.

**Definition of "Sale" under CCPA:**  We do not sell your personal information as defined by the CCPA. While we share anonymized analytics data with Firebase, we do not believe this constitutes a "sale" under the CCPA because the data is anonymized and does not directly identify you. We continually review our data practices to ensure compliance with the CCPA's evolving definition of "sale."

---

## 6. Data Retention

- Data you provide (API key, prompts, context) is stored only locally on your device and may be deleted at your discretion.
- Anonymized analytics and crash data are retained only as long as necessary for:
  - Diagnostics and product improvement (typically up to 24 months).
  - Legal and regulatory compliance.

We will delete anonymized data after [24] months unless we are required to retain it for legal or regulatory purposes.

---

## 7. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the security of the App and any data processed through Firebase. However:
- Ivy Apps Ltd does **not control** or have access to your locally stored prompts, API key, or context.
- You are solely responsible for safeguarding your device and the data you input or store in the App.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

PocketVibe is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. All users are required to confirm they are over 13 before using the app. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child, we will delete it promptly.

---

## 9. International Transfers

All data is processed in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR. Firebase services may store anonymized data in data centers outside the EU. We rely on Google’s adherence to standard contractual clauses (SCCs) and relevant safeguards as approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal data to countries outside the EEA. Specifically, we rely on the SCCs incorporated into the Google Cloud Data Processing Addendum. You can find more information about Google's data protection measures and obtain a copy of the SCCs at [Link to Google Cloud's Data Processing Addendum].

## 10. Third-Party Services

PocketVibe connects to third-party large language model (LLM) providers using your API key. These services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.

**Ivy Apps Ltd is not responsible for any information you share with third-party services, including but not limited to your API key, prompts, or AI outputs. You are solely responsible for your interactions with these providers.**

We recommend you review the privacy policies and terms of use of any third-party services you use with PocketVibe.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by in-app notification and/or email (if you have provided us with your email address).
